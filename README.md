### Project

Intensive care unit(ICU) is a department in the hospital to treat patients with life-threatening disease or injury. It is also home to some of the most sophisticated patient technology within hospitals, such as vital sign monitors and mechanical ventilators. Data generated in the process are often precious and contain meaningful information. How to integrate data and help doctors make fast and accurate decisions is the research goal of many clinicians and data scientists. 

Our group is proposing an ICU Dashboard designed to connect doctors and researchers. We will solve problems such as how to effectively present the data from a massive ICU database and how to incorporate research results (Statistical, Machine Learning models) with data visualization tools. The goal of this project is to build an interface based on current ICU data from [MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/) which is a database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. 

A typical Dashboard looks like [this](https://hospinf.shinyapps.io/hospinf/)
