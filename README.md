## Intro
For people in proteomics, such as scientists in the pharma industry and researcher in academia, using software to generate reports is a common task they are performing. Msstatsand MsstatsTMT are two R packages developed by Olga Vitek Lab in Northeastern University, implemented with the most advanced algorithm. They have function include Data converting, protein summarization, group comparison, and visualization. 

## Problem
Most people using these two packages are beginners in programming. They are facing two obstacles, using R to write code and generate a formal report with R.  R is a high programming language developed by Statisticians, focused on data manipulation and analysis. But in the field of proteomics, not everyone is skilled in R, some are not skilled in programming at all. In this situation, the advantages of using R as an analytical tool became a burden. Since they tend to spend more time learning the language itself rather than the packages, and the probability of generating error becomes very high.  

## Target users

Scientists with experience in proteomics and want to perform protein quantification algorithm with R and write a report.

## Solution

The solution is a web-based interface with automatic formal report generate function. 

The interface contains 4-5 parts, which corresponding to each function in those R packages. In each step, users will have several choices about how they want to do the calculation/manipulation and how would the results look like(either direct visualization or summarization)

The report will contain reports from each step; users will have options such as trim the report and the style or a report style such as a plot/graph-based  or text-based
