### Personal Background: 
My name is Sicheng (Si-Cheng). I am a second year Master Student in Data Science program at CCIS. I have a background in Statistics and Machine Learning, my main programming lauguage is R. Here is my [personal website](https://sichenghao1992.github.io/)

### Project #1

Intensive care unit(ICU) is a department in the hospital to treat patients with life-threatening disease or injury. It is also home to some of the most sophisticated patient technology within hospitals, such as vital sign monitors and mechanical ventilators. Data generated in the process are often precious and contain meaningful information. How to integrate data and help doctors make fast and accurate decisions is the research goal of many clinicians and data scientists. 

The goal of this project is to build an interface based on current ICU data from [MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/) which is a database developed by MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, to help doctors extract information from data and make the critical decision faster. 

The interface I am planning to use is Shiny. This is an R based visualization tool that integrates R with javascript and HTML. A template of this project:

### Project #2

MSstats and MSstatsTMT are two R packages that our lab, they are widely used in the area of proteomics. The main function of these two packages is protein quantification. 

The main users of this two packages do not have a lot R experience and statistical analysis. To make them use these two packages easier, I proposed a project plan to build a UI interface based on these two packages. The interface will not require any programming experience and will automatically generate PDF or HTML report.

### Project #3

A system of telling people how long they need to wait. 

In modern society, especially big cities. We pretty much need to get in line for everything, RMV, food sometimes hospital. The very disappointing truth is, we often don't know how long is the waiting time and this is sometimes very stressful. With all the technology and scientific breakthrough we have in the world, this is just a disgrace.

I propose a solution of waiting time forecast system. By using text, call or social media, give people updates about their waiting time and how many people are in front of them. By using this automatics system, people waiting in the  RMV or restaurant will have a clear idea of how long they should expect, so they can plan their time accordingly and reduce stress. 

Procedures:(sketch)
1. Get in line: Record information to the system. 
2. Update waiting time.
3. Alert people when it is almost their turn will be using their location information, previous behavior and speed of their respondent
4. Evaluate and update predicting model. 

A key point of this project is figuring out why people get stressful waiting in line and how to reduce this. Another key point is how to alert people effectively so they will get back to the shop on time.
