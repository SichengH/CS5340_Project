### Personal Background: 
My name is Sicheng (Si-Cheng). I am a second year Master Student in Data Science program at CCIS. I have a background in Statistics and Machine Learning, my main programming lauguage is R. Here is my [personal website](https://sichenghao1992.github.io/)

### Project #1

Intensive care unit(ICU) is a department in the hospital to treat patients with life-threatening disease or injury. It is also home to some of the most sophisticated patient technology within hospitals, such as vital sign monitors and mechanical ventilators. Data generated in the process are often precious and contain meaningful information. How to integrate data and help doctors make fast and accurate decisions is the research goal of many clinicians and data scientists. 

The goal of this project is to build an interface based on current ICU data from [MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/) which is a database developed by MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, to help doctors extract information from data and make the critical decision faster. 

The interface I am planning to use is Shiny. This is an R based visualization tool that integrates R with javascript and HTML. A template of this project:

MSstats and MSstatsTMT are two R packages that our lab, they are widely used in the area of proteomics. The main function of these two packages is protein quantification. 

The main users of this two packages do not have a lot R experience and statistical analysis. To make them use these two packages easier, I proposed a project plan to build a UI interface based on these two packages.
